# Debug Menu add-on for Godot 4.x

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Calinou/media/master/godot-debug-menu-demo/screenshot.png)

**Displays performance information in a Godot project during gameplay.**
Can be used when running from the editor and in exported projects.
Inspired by id Tech 6/7's performance overlay.

This repository only contains the add-on. See
[godot-extended-libraries/godot-debug-menu-demo](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-debug-menu-demo)
for the demonstration project.

## Features

- Features compact and full display modes, with the compact mode only displaying
  FPS, frametime and framerate cap.
- Displays FPS, frametime, CPU time and GPU time graphs with a summary of the
  best/worst/average frametimes over recently drawn frames.
- Displays hardware information, including graphics driver version.
- Displays software information, including project version (if specified in the
  `application/config/version` custom project setting) and graphics settings.
- Works with the Forward+, Mobile and Compatibility rendering methods.
- Works with 2D and 3D projects.
- Works when running the project from the editor, but also in exported projects
  (debug and release).

## Why use this debug menu?

- Compared to the Godot editor's Profiler, Monitors and Visual Profiler bottom
  panels, you can look at an in-game debug menu while the project is running,
  even in fullscreen if you only have a single monitor.
    - Rendering performance is highly dependent on window size, so resizing the
      window is not advised for reliable performance measurements in real world
      scenarios.
- This debug menu accurately displays graphs and best/worst frametime metrics
  over a period of the last 150 rendered frames, which is useful to diagnose
  stuttering issues. The Monitor bottom panel is only updated once a second and
  doesn't feature a 1% low FPS metric, which makes tracking stuttering
  difficult when relying solely on the monitors.
- This debug menu can be used in exported projects to reliably test performance
  without any editor interference. This includes testing on mobile and Web
  platforms, which tend to be more difficult to set up for profiling within
  Godot (if it's even possible).
- This debug menu can be used in exported projects for tech support purposes.
  For example, in a bug report, you could ask a player to upload screenshots
  with the debug menu visible to troubleshoot performance issues.

External tools such as RTSS or [MangoHud](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud)
provide some insight on how well a project actually runs. However, they lack
information on engine-specific things such as per-frame CPU/GPU time and
graphics settings.

## Installation

### Using the Asset Library

- Open the Godot editor.
- Navigate to the **AssetLib** tab at the top of the editor and search for
  "antialiased line2d".
- Install the
  [*Debug Menu*](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1902)
  plugin. Keep all files checked during installation.
- In the editor, open **Project > Project Settings**, go to **Plugins**
  and enable the **Debug Menu** plugin.

### Manual installation

Manual installation lets you use pre-release versions of this add-on by
following its `master` branch.

- Clone this Git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-debug-menu.git
```

Alternatively, you can
[download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-debug-menu/archive/master.zip)
if you do not have Git installed.

- Move the `addons/` folder to your project folder.
- In the editor, open **Project > Project Settings**, go to **Plugins**
  and enable the **Antialiased Line2D** plugin.

## Usage

- Press <kbd>F3</kbd> while the project is running. This cycles between no debug
  menu, a compact debug menu (only FPS and frametime visible) and a full debug
  menu.

The key to cycle the debug menu is currently hardcoded. You can change it in
`addons/debug_menu/debug_menu.gd`'s `_input()` method.
